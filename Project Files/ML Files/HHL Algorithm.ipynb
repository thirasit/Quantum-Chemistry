    "# **HHL Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [HHL algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm_for_linear_systems_of_equations) underlies many quantum machine learning protocols, but it is a highly nontrivial algorithm with lots of conditions. In this notebook, we implement the algorithm to gain a better understanding of how it works and when it works efficiently. The notebook is derived from the [computational appendix](https://gitlab.com/apozas/bayesian-dl-quantum) of the paper [Bayesian Deep Learning on a Quantum Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11463). We restrict our attention to inverting a $2\\times 2$ matrix, following Pan *et al*.'s implementation [[1](#1)] of the algorithm."

    "## **Quantum phase estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to encode the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ in an additional register. This is done via quantum phase estimation of the evolution described by the Hamiltonian $A$ during some time $t_0$, $\\exp(\\imath A t_0)$. The protocol has three steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we prepare the ancilla state $\\left|\\psi_0\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{T-1}\\left|\\tau\\right\\rangle$. Why this state? It will control the time evolution: it is like a clock, turning on evolution for a certain amount of time. The original HHL algorithm suggests a weighted superposition of all states $\\tau$ that minimizes errors in following steps in the algorithm. However, for our implementation, a uniform superposition already gives good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a superposition of $A$ as a Hamiltonian applied for different durations. Since the eigenvalues are always situated on the complex unit circle, these differently evolved components in the superposition help reveal the eigenstructure. So we apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution $\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{T-1}\\left|\\tau\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\tau\\right|\\otimes e^{\\imath A\\tau t_0/T}$ on $\\left|\\psi_0\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|b\\right\\rangle$. This operation evolves the state $\\left|b\\right\\rangle$ according to the Hamiltonian $A$ for the time $\\tau$ determined by the state $\\left|\\psi_0\\right\\rangle$. Given that in $\\left|\\psi_0\\right\\rangle$ we have a superposition of all possible time steps between $0$ and $T$, we will end up with a superposition of all possible evolutions, and a suitable choice of number of timesteps $T$ and total evolution time $t_0$ allow to encode binary representations of the eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final step, we apply an inverse Fourier transformation that writes the phases (that, recall, encode the eigenvalues of $A$) into new registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our $2\\times 2$ case, the circuit is massively simplified. Given that the matrix $A$ has eigenvalues that are powers of $2$, we can choose $T=4$, $t_0=2\\pi$ to obtain exact results with just two controlled evolutions."
